## Technology
* Giphy API, Ajax, JSON, jQuery, JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS3, and HTML5.

## About
* This app pulls an array of Star Wars topics from the base code to populate buttons on the screen. If the user clicks on a button, an Ajax request is sent using the Giphy API to pull 10 gifs to the browser, using the button's value property as the search query. Users can also create their own functional button with a search term, which is added to the list.
